This design was modified from the original here:
  - https://github.com/jcard0na/mearm
I further modified the design above to:
  - Reorganize the SVG files from  to be printable on half of one 20x12 inch acrylic sheets in a glowforge
  - Fixed 4 bugs I found after printing and assembling:
    - right arm holes are slightly off-center
    - machine square slightly misaligned w notch
    - one long piece holes very off-center AND too large holes (need to be self-tapping
    - long-end of triangle hole too large (needs to be self-tapping)
